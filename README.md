# ASCII Jetpack Joyride

## Introduction
Din is a mandalorian living in the post-empire era. He is one of the last remaining members of his clan in the galaxy and is currently on a mission for the Guild.

He needs to rescue The Child, who strikingly resembles Master Yoda, a legendary Jedi grandmaster. But there are lots of enemies and obstacles in his way, trying to prevent Din from saving Baby Yoda.

Din is wearing classic mandalorian armour and has a jetpack as well as a blaster with unlimited bullets. Youâ€™ve got to help him fight his way through.
